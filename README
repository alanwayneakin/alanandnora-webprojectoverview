Archive Ingest Status & Forward Plan

Date: 09/01/2026

Current State

One-time archive ingest initiated via Raspberry Pi + rclone

Source: Samsung external hard disk

Scope: personal photos, videos, audio, full university recordings

Estimated volume: ~500 GB

Destination: Cloudflare R2 object storage

Method: append-only, folder structure preserved, resume-safe

No deduplication or reorganization during ingest

Objective: canonical, immutable personal archive

Cost Awareness

Storage: ~$7–8/month for ~500 GB (R2 standard)

Upload: negligible one-time cost

Egress: free from R2

Request costs: minimal unless browsing large directories

Costs depend mainly on storage tier and access patterns

WordPress Integration Plan

WordPress acts as archive browser, metadata layer, and access control

Media remains in R2 (not in WordPress storage)

Signed URLs used for secure access

Content organized by year, event, category

Archive remains source of truth

Redundancy and meaningless data removed gradually

Video Strategy

Do not stream raw video directly from R2 via WordPress

Two options:

Cloudflare Stream (managed, optimized, predictable)

Signed-URL progressive download for rare viewing

Streaming is opt-in per folder

Videos classified as archive-only or actively viewed

Long-Term Archiving Principles

Immutable base archive

Organization added post-ingest

Metadata lives outside media files

Possible tiers: hot, warm, cold

Storage class decisions revisitable

Portability & Exit Strategy

No proprietary formats

No WordPress dependency

Full export via rclone always possible

WordPress can be shut down without data loss

Migration targets: other object storage, NAS, offline cold storage

Goal: ability to end Cloudflare, Hostinger, and WordPress cleanly

Next Steps

Complete ingest and verify integrity

Decide video handling strategy

Define storage tier usage

Connect WordPress read-only

Design metadata and browsing structure

Begin pruning duplicates and low-value data

Web & Hosting Architecture
Sites

Public: alanandnora.com (Cloudflare Pages, static, free)

Private: private.alanandnora.com (WordPress on Hostinger)

Family: family.alanandnora.com (separate WordPress install)

Each WordPress site:

Separate install, database, admin

DNS handled by Cloudflare

Media stored externally in Cloudflare R2

One private R2 bucket per site

Signed, time-limited URLs only

No public buckets, no public media

Only recurring cost: Hostinger hosting
Everything can be shut down by canceling Hostinger

WordPress → Cloudflare R2 Media Storage
Status

WordPress: healthy

Media Cloud plugin: active and verified

R2 integration: fully functional

Authentication validated

Uploads stored directly in R2

Signed URL delivery working

No public file exposure

Cloud icon in Media Library = private remote storage (expected)

Architecture

WordPress on Hostinger

Cloudflare R2 (S3-compatible)

Media Cloud plugin handles uploads, offload, signed URLs

R2 Configuration

Bucket: private-archive

Permissions: Object Read / Write

Scoped API token

Private bucket only

Endpoint: https://<ACCOUNT_ID>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com

Media Cloud Settings

Provider: Other S3-Compatible

Bucket: private-archive

Region: US East (N. Virginia)

Path-style endpoints: enabled

Uploads: images, videos, docs enabled

Privacy ACL: private

Signed URLs: enabled (short expiry)

Validation

Upload, delete, database integration verified

Warning “file not public” = expected

Frontend delivery uses signed URLs only

Outcome: privacy-first, secure, future-compatible media handling

R2 Storage Separation Overview
Buckets

family-archive

private-archive

Both:

Fully private

Independent

No shared media views

Suggested Structure (Optional)

/photos
/videos
/documents
/events
/secure

Access

Scoped API token

Object Read + Write only

No public access

Upload Methods

Browser upload for small files

rclone / AWS CLI for large files

Benefits:

Clear separation

Handles large media

Private by default

Low cost, scalable, future-proof

Cost & Shutdown Reference (For Future Me)

Active costs:

Domain: ~$10–15/year

Hostinger WordPress: promo-based, higher on renewal

Free:

Cloudflare DNS

Cloudflare Pages

GitHub

WordPress software

To stop all recurring costs:

Cancel Hostinger WordPress plan

Disable domain auto-renew if desired

Cloudflare free plan can remain indefinitely

Purpose: clarity, sustainability, and long-term control
Principle: nothing here traps me
Result: private, calm, portable family archive built to last
