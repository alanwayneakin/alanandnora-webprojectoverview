# Alan & Nora – Web + Private Portal Overview

This file exists to help me (Alan) remember:
- what systems I set up
- what things cost
- how to shut it ALL down if needed
- why things are structured the way they are

This is meant to protect my brain, my time, and my money.

---

## ⚠️ FINANCIAL & COMMITMENT CONTROL
### If I ever want to **stop all costs completely**, here is the checklist.

### 1️⃣ Cancel WordPress Hosting (Hostinger)
This is currently the only thing that regularly costs money.
- Log into Hostinger
- Go to **Billing / Subscriptions**
- Cancel the WordPress hosting plan
- This will remove:  
  `private.alanandnora.com` ⭐

👉 Cancelling Hostinger stops ALL *paid* hosting costs.

Nothing else is currently charging monthly.

### 2️⃣ Domain Name Renewal
The `alanandnora.com` domain renews annually.
If I want to stop paying even for the domain:
- Log into my domain registrar (Cloudflare or wherever I bought it)
- Turn off **auto-renew**
- Let it expire if I ever choose to

👉 If I still want the name, I can just keep paying the yearly domain fee.

### 3️⃣ Cloudflare
Cloudflare is currently **free plan**.
- If Hostinger is cancelled, Cloudflare will cost **$0**
- I can leave Cloudflare running forever with no charge

### 4️⃣ Future Storage (NOT Active Yet)
If one day I add:
- Cloudflare R2
- Backblaze B2
- AWS S3

Then:
- Those are pay-as-you-go
- I can cancel/delete buckets any time to stop billing

---

## 💳 What Might Be Charging My Card?
Right now, the potential or active charges in this project are:

- Hostinger WordPress hosting  
  → yearly prepay / discounted promo / renews higher unless cancelled  

- Domain registration (`alanandnora.com`)  
  → yearly renewal fee

Cloudflare Pages = **$0**
Cloudflare DNS = **$0**
GitHub = **$0**
WordPress software = **$0**

📌 Future-Me Rule:
If I ever feel overwhelmed, I can cancel Hostinger and keep only the domain + public website.  
That returns costs to almost nothing.

## 1️⃣ Big Picture (What Exists)

- **Public website**
  - `https://alanandnora.com`
  - simple, public face of our life
  - hosted FREE at Cloudflare Pages

- **Private family home (planned / being built)**
  - `https://private.alanandnora.com`
  - private login-only space
  - powered by WordPress on Hostinger
  - long-term emotional + memory + archive space

- **DNS + edge security**
  - managed by Cloudflare

- **Future big storage (not active yet)**
  - Cloudflare R2 or similar
  - only when content grows huge

## 🧠 Why It’s Built This Way
- Public site should stay lightweight and open
- Private life deserves its own controlled space
- Separate systems = cleaner security + less risk
- Cloudflare gives speed + free + control
- WordPress gives private login + emotional space
- Storage can grow gradually

## ❤️ Philosophy of This Project
This is not a tech playground.
It is a **family home.**

- It should feel peaceful

If life changes:
I can simplify.
I can pause.
I can shut it down.
Nothing here traps me.

That’s intentional.
