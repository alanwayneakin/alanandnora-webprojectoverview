WordPress → Cloudflare R2 Media Storage (Secure, Private, Signed URLs)

This site uses Cloudflare R2 as external media storage for WordPress, via the Media Cloud plugin. The system is configured to keep all media fully private while still allowing WordPress to view and edit files using signed URLs.

No media is publicly accessible on the internet.
Uploads are secure, authenticated, and verifiable.

Architecture

WordPress hosted on Hostinger

Cloudflare R2 as S3-compatible object storage

Media Cloud plugin for:

Upload handling

Storage offload

Signed URL delivery

Secure admin access

Status

WordPress site: Healthy

Media Cloud: Active & Verified

R2 Integration: 100% Functional

Authentication: Working (validated by test suite)

Uploads: Stored directly to R2

Security posture: Private storage + signed URL access

Thumbnails in grid: intentionally cloud icon only (by design, for private storage)

Image editing inside WordPress: Works

Frontend image delivery: Uses signed URLs

No public exposure of files

Cloudflare R2 Configuration

Secure URL Settings

Signed URLs: Enabled

Expiry: configurable (currently short-duration secure access)

This allows:
✔️ Private storage
✔️ Admin access
✔️ Secure frontend delivery

Test Validation

Media Cloud diagnostic suite successfully verified:

Connected to storage

Database integration correct

File upload successful

File deletion successful

Only warning: "file not public" → expected behavior

This is a private storage system, not a public CDN.

Expected Behavior

Cloud icon appears in Media Library grid view
→ This indicates “stored remotely + private”
→ This is normal and correct

Images open and edit correctly in WordPress

Files deliver via signed URLs when needed

No images are “floating on the web”.

Outcome

This setup achieves:

Secure cloud-based media offloading

Zero public exposure

Clean integration

Reliable upload pipeline

Signed URL delivery

Future-compatible architecture

This system is intentionally designed for privacy-first media handling rather than public CDN-style delivery.

If you ever want to switch to:

Public media hosting

CDN delivery

Public thumbnails

Hybrid privacy

…those can be layered on later. For now, this configuration is stable, secure, and validate

#Alan & Nora - R2 Cloudflare storage overview


Purpose: Create two completely separate storage spaces so different personal content areas remain independent and never mixed.

1️⃣ Buckets Created

Two R2 buckets are used:

family-archive

private-archive

Both buckets:

Must remain Private

Are fully independent

Do not share a global “All Media” view

Provide emotional + contextual separation

2️⃣ Recommended Folder Structure

(Optional but helpful long-term)

Inside family-archive

/photos

/videos

/documents

/events

Inside private-archive

/photos

/videos

/secure

This ensures clarity and order as storage grows.

3️⃣ Manage Access (API Token)

Purpose: allow uploads (including very large files) and future automation.

Steps:

Go to Cloudflare R2

Open Manage Access

Create API Token

Permissions required:

Object Read

Object Write

Restrict token to:

family-archive

private-archive

Save token securely

No public access is enabled.

4️⃣ Uploading Files

Option A — Normal uploads

R2 → select bucket → Upload

Option B — Very large files (recommended for 4GB+)

rclone

or AWS CLI (R2 is S3-compatible)

This avoids browser timeout limits.

5️⃣ Benefits of This Design

Clear separation between life areas

No single “all media everywhere” view

Handles huge video files easily

Private by default and secure

Low-cost storage that scales

Safe foundation for integrating into the private website later

6️⃣ Notes

Nothing here is public by default

Only accessible via Cloudflare account or API token

Website will reference this storage later when ready

Design is future-proof and long-term maintainable


# Alan & Nora – Web + Private Portal Overview

This file exists to help me (Alan) remember:
- what systems I set up
- what things cost
- how to shut it ALL down if needed
- why things are structured the way they are

This is meant to protect my brain, my time, and my money.

---

## ⚠️ FINANCIAL & COMMITMENT CONTROL
### If I ever want to **stop all costs completely**, here is the checklist.

### 1️⃣ Cancel WordPress Hosting (Hostinger)
This is currently the only thing that regularly costs money.
- Log into Hostinger
- Go to **Billing / Subscriptions**
- Cancel the WordPress hosting plan
- This will remove:  
  `private.alanandnora.com` ⭐

👉 Cancelling Hostinger stops ALL *paid* hosting costs.

Nothing else is currently charging monthly.

### 2️⃣ Domain Name Renewal
The `alanandnora.com` domain renews annually.
If I want to stop paying even for the domain:
- Log into my domain registrar (Cloudflare or wherever I bought it)
- Turn off **auto-renew**
- Let it expire if I ever choose to

👉 If I still want the name, I can just keep paying the yearly domain fee.

### 3️⃣ Cloudflare
Cloudflare is currently **free plan**.
- If Hostinger is cancelled, Cloudflare will cost **$0**
- I can leave Cloudflare running forever with no charge

### 4️⃣ Future Storage (NOT Active Yet)
If one day I add:
- Cloudflare R2
- Backblaze B2
- AWS S3

Then:
- Those are pay-as-you-go
- I can cancel/delete buckets any time to stop billing

---

## 💳 What Might Be Charging My Card?
Right now, the potential or active charges in this project are:

- Hostinger WordPress hosting  
  → yearly prepay / discounted promo / renews higher unless cancelled  

- Domain registration (`alanandnora.com`)  
  → yearly renewal fee

Cloudflare Pages = **$0**
Cloudflare DNS = **$0**
GitHub = **$0**
WordPress software = **$0**

📌 Future-Me Rule:
If I ever feel overwhelmed, I can cancel Hostinger and keep only the domain + public website.  
That returns costs to almost nothing.

---

## 1️⃣ Big Picture (What Exists)

- **Public website**
  - `https://alanandnora.com`
  - simple, public face of our life
  - hosted FREE at Cloudflare Pages

- **Private family home (planned / being built)**
  - `https://private.alanandnora.com`
  - private login-only space
  - powered by WordPress on Hostinger
  - long-term emotional + memory + archive space

- **DNS + edge security**
  - managed by Cloudflare

- **Future big storage (not active yet)**
  - Cloudflare R2 or similar
  - only when content grows huge

---

---

## 💰 Cost Overview (Reality-Based)

### Currently Active Costs
- Domain: ~$10–$15 / year
- Hostinger: ~$3–$10 / month equivalent depending on promo + renewal

### Cloudflare
- DNS: free
- Pages: free

### Future Only If Needed
- Cloudflare R2 storage:
  - ~ $5–10 per **terabyte per month** storage
  - bandwidth extra but reasonable
- Only needed when I truly have LOTS of content

---

## 🧠 Why It’s Built This Way
- Public site should stay lightweight and open
- Private life deserves its own controlled space
- Separate systems = cleaner security + less risk
- Cloudflare gives speed + free + control
- WordPress gives private login + emotional space
- Storage can grow gradually

---

## 🧭 Growth Plan

### Phase 1 – Now
- Public site online
- Hostinger set up
- private.alanandnora.com WordPress installed
- Private access only
- Alan + Nora accounts created

### Phase 2 – Fill Slowly
- Add documents
- Add some photos
- Add early videos
- Create structure

### Phase 3 – When Storage Becomes Big
- Add Cloudflare R2 or similar
- Move large video to external storage
- Keep WordPress as front door + permissions

---

## ❤️ Philosophy of This Project
This is not a tech playground.
It is a **family home.**

- It should feel peaceful
- Not overwhelming
- Sustainable financially
- Sustainable emotionally
- Built to last decades

If life changes:
I can simplify.
I can pause.
I can shut it down.
Nothing here traps me.

That’s intentional.
